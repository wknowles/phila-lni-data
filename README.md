Goofing around with Philadelphia's L&I data ==> [Licenses and Inspections Business Licenses](https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/licenses-and-inspections-business-licenses)

---

Index of pages:

* [map](http://wknowles.github.io/phila-lni-data/index.html) of L&I districts.
* [d3](http://wknowles.github.io/phila-lni-data/d3.html) chart showing active housing inspection licenses sorted by application year - TODO: add day / month / year selectors & axis
* [d3-census](http://wknowles.github.io/phila-lni-data/d3-census.html) map showing census tracts - tract and total number of active licenses are shown in browser console, I just have to get them to display as a choropleth on the map.
